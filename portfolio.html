            <p> A website like YouTube, suggests content to watch and uses the consumed content to create more suggestions. Data creates more data to heap upon itself. The installation "tubed" replicates this through a customised recmendation AI. It plays with the narrative of users engaging in consumption and becoming a part of the production. In Pratyush's installation, a recommendation AI is traversing through YouTube content. When a human spectator enters the system, they consume a section of the content generation system. What they consume, and by extension, they themselves become a part of the data that is used to build the AI in the first place. Consumption, which is built on AI suggestions, is the fuel to build the Artificial Intelligence.</p>

            <p>'tubed' was presented as part of the exhibition A Vial Piece of Information: Fragments of A Greater Context curated by artist-curator Thomas Heidtmann of Lacuna Lab.</p>

            <p>How much time do we spend assimilating information? What is the source of our information today? Surely it used to be books and stories and traditions, but how about now? </p>

            <p>Maybe a hundred years ago, the amount of information with a person mattered- the knowledge that the person created out of that information mattered. It was this knowledge that translated into power and such knowledge was hard to come by, restricted to a small percentage of the populace. Today, a large amount of information is available free of apparent restrictions, via internet. There are many people who are producing information, with various intents of propagation. Given how vast such repositories of information are, the power today, may not lie in assimilating as much knowledge as possible, but in filtering as much as required.</p>

            <p> YouTube has become synonymous with popular culture, with a channel for the nichest of niche topics. Social Blade (a website which tracks social media data), estimates around 31 million creators and the news suggests that by April 2019, 265 millions of the Indian population had YouTube accounts. This implies that both consumption and production of content in this medium is rampant. While "digital detox" has become somewhat of a trend, the amount of time we spend watching  videos can be grossly underestimated.</p>

            <p>This installation, which is intended as a data art piece, imagines YouTube to be an all beholding source of knowledge. It then looks at how much time and space we allocate to YouTube in our lives. The movement of each line signifies the movement of the seekbar and each colour identifies a single user. The number of strands is an appropriation of number of users on the voyage to seek information.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Breathe Pong</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p> Breathe is an interactive installation dealing with the primal activity of breathing. Each installation within this umbrella is an attempt to critique aspects relevant to the idea of breathing.</p>

            <p>Breathe-Pong, reflects on controlled breathing. Its practice dates back to the foundation age of yoga and acts both as a health indicator as well as a means of fitness improvement. Instead of giving a numerical value to someone's breathing capabilities as an interaction, the installation morphs into a game environment, where breathing gets mapped as an input. The representative form is that of a retro-game called "Pong" (1972), which was one of the first commercially successful games made. Like the original game, two players can compete for better reflexes, and in this alteration, their breathe control.</p>
