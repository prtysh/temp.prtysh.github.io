                    <p> Pratyush Raman is a practising artist from Bangalore, whose work revolves around education, technology and playfulness of mathematics. He teaches creative coding and new media at Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology. His enquiries deal with consciousness, conditioning and fiction in the contemporary paradigm of civilisation. At Serendipity Arts Festival, his installation work, 'Breathe Pong', reconstructed Pong, one of the earliest arcade games, as an interactive reflection of breathing. He uses code, music and painting as his media of expression. </p>

                    <p> Pratyush Raman’s enquiry is in observing machine relationships and influence on humans in the present and raise a sense of awareness and reflection. </p>
